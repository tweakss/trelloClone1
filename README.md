# TrelloClone1
Made from *scratch* using React, Redux, Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

## App's purpose
In general it allows one or more people to create lists of tasks and share them with others for collaboration. But of course these "lists" and "tasks" doesn't have to be your to do lists, they could be anything you want.

#### Note
Before trying it out, please note that some parts of the app might seem unfinished (ex: the appearance), but they are left like that on purpose. If you want to know more then scroll down to "If you want to know more..." section then to "Overall Goal/Explanation".

### Overall Goal/Explanation
You might notice that this website or app doesn't seem appealing and maybe uninteresting. I agree with you, it is uninteresting and not appealing. My goal was to build something simple, but functional using the bare minimum of tools and building this app with the bare minimum of tools meant that each/every part had to be built/made from the ground up.
A lot of details and basic logic had to be built or sorted out than you normally would, so I left a few parts (appearance wise) completely untouched just to show the difference. Building out each part from scratch like this was also very time consuming so for the sake of moving on I had to leave a few things untouched. Anyways, thank you for reading this far.
